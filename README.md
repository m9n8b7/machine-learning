## General info

The programs allows you to reduce the number of variables.
How did I prepare a dataset?
I used the flat.csv file (the same as for the multiply reduction) and segmented the flat (with K-means).
Unfortunately, the predictability of the program (PCA) is unsatisfactory. I'm working on it. Most likely, the problem lies in clustering.

## Technologies
Project is usualy created with:
* Python 3.7, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
* SciKit

## Setup
To run this project You need Python 3.7 with installed libraries or you can use Anaconda (Spyder or Jupyter).
Remember to put a data file in the folder.
