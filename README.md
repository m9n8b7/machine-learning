## General info
This is a few projects created for a fictitious real estate agency. 
The agency does not exist, but the data is mostly real and comes from sites dedicated to real estate.
Each set of programs has its own redme.
## Technologies
Project is usualy created with:
* Python 3.7, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
* SciKit

if it is different, it is written in redme

## Setup
To run this project You need Python 3.7 with installed libraries or you can use Anaconda (Spyder or Jupyter).
Remember to put a data file in the folder.
